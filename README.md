ALiCE Onboarding Web component allows the automatic capture of documents and video selfie of the user in real time from the camera of your device. It also simplifies the communication with the onboarding API to facilitate rapid integration and development. It manages the onboarding flow configuration: requested documents and order.

The main features are:

- Automatic capture of documents and video selfie of the user in real time from the camera of your device.
- Communication with the onboarding API to facilitate rapid integration and development.
- Manage the onboarding flow configuration: requested documents and order.


## Installation :computer:

```
npm install aliceonboarding
```

### Import the library

Include ALiCE Onboarding as a regular script tag on your page:

```html
<script src='dist/aliceonboarding.umd.min.js'></script>
```

## Usage :wave:

### Reserve a HTML element in your application

Add a div element with onboarding tag inside in your page to load the Alice Onboarding component:

```html
<div id="alice-onboarding-mount"/>
```

### Configuration

You can configure the onboarding flow with the following code:

```js
let userToken = "<ADD-YOUR-USER-TOKEN-HERE>"

let config = new aliceonboarding.OnboardingConfig()
  .withUserToken(userToken)
  .withAddSelfieStage()
  .withAddDocumentStage(onboarding.DocumentType.IDCARD, "ESP")
  .withAddDocumentStage(onboarding.DocumentType.DRIVERLICENSE, "ESP")
```

### Using ALiCE Onboarding on Production

Once you configured the ALiCE Onboarding Flow, you can run the process with:

```js
function onSuccess(userInfo) {console.log("onSuccess: " + userInfo)}
function onFailure(error) {console.log("onFailure: " + error)}
function onCancel() { console.log("onCancel")}

new aliceonboarding.Onboarding("#alice-onboarding-mount", config).run(onSuccess, onFailure, onCancel);
```

Where `userToken` is used to secure requests made by the users on their mobile devices or web clients. You should obtain it from your Backend.


### Using ALiCE Onboarding on Trial

On the other hand, if you want to test the technology without integrate it with your backend, you can use our Sandbox Service. This service associates a user mail with the ALiCE Onboarding `user_id`. You can create an user and obtain its `USER_TOKEN` already linked with the email.

For more information about the Sandbox, please check the following [doc](https://docs.alicebiometrics.com/onboarding/access.html#using-alice-onboarding-sandbox).

Use the `aliceonboarding.logInWithSandbox` function to ease the integration.

```js
let sandboxToken = "<ADD-YOUR-SANDBOX-TOKEN-HERE>"
let userInfo = new onboarding.UserInfo(email)

aliceonboarding.logInWithSandbox(sandboxToken, userInfo)
  .then(userToken => {
    // Obtain previously configured OnboardingConfig object
    let config = getOnboardingConfig(userToken, appSettings);
    
    function onSuccess(userInfo) {console.log("onSuccess: " + userInfo)}
    function onFailure(error) {console.log("onFailure: " + error)}
    function onCancel() { console.log("onCancel")}
        
    new aliceonboarding.Onboarding("#alice-onboarding-mount", config).run(onSuccess, onFailure, onCancel);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

Where `sandboxToken` is a temporal token for testing the technology in a development/testing environment. 

An `email` is required to associate it to an ALiCE Onboarding `user_id`. You can also add some additional information from your user.

```js
userInfo = new onboarding.UserInfo(
  email,
  firstName,
  lastName
)
```

## Demo

Check our JSFiddle demo [here](https://jsfiddle.net/alicebiometrics/nskyhfou/embedded/). Remember you must add your `SANDBOX_TOKEN` credentials. If you have already integrated ALiCE Onboarding in your backend, remove the `aliceonboarding.logInWithSandbox` function and use your retrieved `USER_TOKEN`. 

## Customize

##### Localization

```js
let userToken = "<ADD-YOUR-USER-TOKEN-HERE>"
let language = "en" (default)

let config = new aliceonboarding.OnboardingConfig()
  .withUserToken(userToken)
  .withAddSelfieStage()
  .withAddDocumentStage(onboarding.DocumentType.IDCARD, "ESP")
  .withAddDocumentStage(onboarding.DocumentType.DRIVERLICENSE, "ESP")
  .withCustomLocalization(language)
```

##### Appearance

Modify the CSS styles:

```html
<link rel='stylesheet' href='dist/style.css>
```
